NPC Sprites TODO:

-Use Separate drawing algo

-Render AFTER raycasting walls are done

-Keep 1D depth buffer for wall distances during raycasting

-Give each sprite a height and ground level (shift) properties

-Calculate sprite positions relative to the player position and view angle

-Ignore/Cull sprites outside FOV

-Sort back to front of sprite objects with FOV

-Project sprite location from 2d map space to screen 2d space

-Scale sprites based on distance (scale differently in X/Y, the sprites are not uniform like walls)

-Render sprite textures per column to be occluded by any walls with higher 1d depth buffer
